# Trigger Word Detection

This code is based on the assignment **'Trigger Word Detection'** from the **Sequence Models** course, which is part of the **Deep Learning Specialization**.

## Overview

The project involves:

- **Manual Data Collection**: Gathering and preparing audio data for training and evaluation.
- **Workflow Reproduction**: Implementing and replicating the workflow introduced in the assignment to build a trigger word detection system.
- **Application of the weighted cross-enthropy**: Working with imbalanced data and prevention of overfitting

  
## Objectives

- Develop a system to detect specific keywords or phrases in audio signals.
- Utilize sequence models to enhance the detection accuracy.
